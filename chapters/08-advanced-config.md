# Advanced Config
In this chapter we will talk about how to make a basic personal config for nvim. \
You can decide to stay with the preconfigured configuration and skip this chapter.

Note: Some parts of the next chapters will be irrelevant to a preconfigured configuration I will make sure to let you know you can skip them.

## How to create a config
Fortuently for me there is already a really good [guide for lua configuration](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide).
I recommend to take a look at [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) which is a baisc config you can start from.
