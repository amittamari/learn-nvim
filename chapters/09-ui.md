# UI
One of the strengths of nvim is that it doesn't provide a real native UI, it provides a framework for creating a UI, that way the community improves over time the UI of nvim and gives a different options through different plugins.

If you are using a preconfigured configuration probably the UI is already configured but can be customized, check your preconfigure configuration docs for more.

## Components

### Statusline and Winbar
Statusline is the bottom line right about the command line. \
You can configure it to show whatever you like but usually it shows the current mode, the current file, the current file type and more.

You can set the status line either global or local.
* global - its a one status line that shows information about the current active buffer.
* local - status line for each window even if its inactive, you can choose different design for active and inactive.

Winbar is the same as statusline but for each window, it shows in the top of the window instead of the bottom, its useful if you want per window information but a global status line too.

I personally use [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) I know a lot of people prefer [feline.nvim](https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim), [you can find all the statusline's here](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#statusline)

How to set global/local status line
```lua
vim.opt.laststatus = 3 -- Global line
vim.opt.laststatus = 2 -- The default, local
```
Check `:h laststatus` for all the options

### Tabline
Tabline is the row for the opened tabs, like in a web browser, and other IDE's.

There isn't much to configure, but there are few plugins that implements it:
* [bufferline.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim), that's the one I use.
* [barbar.nvim](https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim) the other famous one.
* [Other tabline's](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#tabline)

### File Explorer(File Tree)
There is a default file explorer for nvim but no many user's use it.

Recommended file trees:
* [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)
* [chadtree](https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree)
* [Other file explorer's](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#file-explorer)

### Colorscheme
As any any code editor there are bunch of color schemes, I use a my own scheme [ofirkai.nvim](https://github.com/ofirgall/ofirkai.nvim), I recommend to choose a color scheme you are already familiar with.
