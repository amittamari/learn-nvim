# Misc
In this chapter I'll mention some misc plugins that I recommend to adapt.

## Basic IDE Functionalities
nvim doesn't provide all the expected functionalities of an IDE, plugins are here to close that gap.

#### Session Manager
I use [vim-session](https://github.com/xolox/vim-session), I don't remember why I like this one especially but it works for me.
[Other Session Manager's](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#session)

#### [Last Place](https://github.com/ethanholz/nvim-lastplace)
Remembers the last place you edited a buffer.

#### [Guess Indent](https://github.com/NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim)
Guess the indent of the file and override the indent settings.

#### [Auto Pairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs)
Adds closures for your pairs, for example when you type `(` it make it `()` and put the cursor in the middle.

#### [Auto Save](https://github.com/Pocco81/auto-save.nvim)
Auto saves the file when a text has been edited, don't worry about losing your data.

#### [Trailing whitespace](https://github.com/ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace)
Be a good programmer and don't leave junk for git.

#### [Multi cursor](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)
If you are already good with mutli cursor, take that skill with you to nvim, if you don't consider to use macros instead.

#### [Terminal in nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim)
Enables an integrated terminal inside nvim.

#### [pasta](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-pasta)
Fix's the issues with vanila paste of nvim.

## Extras

#### [Undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
