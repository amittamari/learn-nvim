# Why should I learn nvim?
As a professional you going to spend a lot of time around your computer especially editing code, you want to do it in the most fun and efficient way, nvim is fun, fun to learn, fun to write with, fun to improve at and most important is very very efficient.

#### You can use vim with any keyboard
vim give you the option to use only the basic keyboard keys, the alphabetical keys, ctrl, alt, shift, escape, enter, you don't need to find where is pageup/down, home, end each time you switch keyboard/laptop.

If you can type on the keyboard you can also use vim as you use to.

#### Keep your hands on the keyboard
vim can be used without mouse at all, it's even recommended to use it without a mouse, it will make you stay in "flow" while programming without move your hand to the mouse and move it back to the keyboard. 

vim is designed to use [type touching](https://www.ratatype.com/static/i/learn/keyboard/en/keyboard.webp), the important binds are next/on the keys your hands always should be on, `asdf jkl;`, it isn't a must to touch type (I don't touch type in 100%) but I recommend to try to switch to it anyways.

#### The right way to program
Its a strong saying but I'm convinced that `nvim` is the right way to program. 

When you are using vim you "talk" to the editor rather then "move" the editor, imagine rather than ask from your friend to pour you a glass of water you would give instruction to your friend for how to pour you a glass of water, which would look like something like this:
1. Open the bottle
1. Grab the glass
1. Grab the bottle
1. Make an angle with the bottle towards the glass
1. Put down the bottle
1. Close the bottle

Wouldn't be easier just say "Hey can you pour me glass of water?"
Well that how it feels to use other editors after you are using vim, vim lets you "talk" to the editor.

#### Feel "at home" everywhere
Most TUIs programs support `vim` binds which will make you feel fast in any program that you usually use, `less`, `man`, `tmux` and many more.

You can fell "at home" in browsers too, with the [vimium extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/he/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)

Edit files through `ssh` with ease

#### Lightweight and Native
nvim is lightweight, startup fasts, renders fast and a lot of the plugins tends to use a strong native binary to run the heavyweight tasks. \
For example, to search for text across the project [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) runs [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

#### Rich plugin ecosystem
nvim has a huge community that develops plugins for everything you can and can't imagine. \
nvim doesn't miss any IDE feature that other IDE's has to offer.
nvim plugins are the first to "evolve" when new tech is coming to the IDE world nvim community is the first to adapt it, e.g: ripgrep

You can take a look at [awesome nvim plugin list](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) I recommend to "watch" to get updates about new plugins.
